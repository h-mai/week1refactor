Refactoring Code 

The purpose of this refactoring exercise was to make this more accessible and easier to follow through for the client. I also had to keep in mind that needed to tidy up the HTML and the CSS without affecting the front end aesthetic of the website.

Here's what I've done to achieve were the following steps:

1. Changed all the tags into readable semantic html tags such as <header> <footer> <figure> <section> <article>
2. Added alt= attritubtes to all the images and icons with detail explainations of what they are.
3. Added title= attritubes to and headings to provide a detailed description for screenreaders.
4. Organised the html and the css into an orderly manner and consolidated any repetitve CSS stylings under one class or element where possible.
5. Spaced and indented all the lines of html so the code is less cluttered and easy to read and edit.
6. The CSS has comments throughout segmenting the different classes and sections with their font and imagestylings/positionings
